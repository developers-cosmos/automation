**INITIATION** :
 - Nowadays everything is automated most of the people are using automated fire alarms in companies, automatic door opening in malls so  why dont we implement that auomation in our houses .
 
 
**INTRODUCTION**:
 - Here we automate the room with by wi-fi module and bluetooth module .With the help of mobile we will able to control the lights ,fans      and other electronic and electric components. Wi-fi module place an important role in our project because it catches the signals from our mobile and implements as per our requirements.The range of our controls is infinite distance if we use wifi module we as if we use bluetooth the range will be only 10metres .
 
 
**PLANNING AND EXECUTION**:
 - The output from our mobile will send to the wifi module or bluetooth module then it will fed into the controller then relays will work according to it.
 
 
**HARDWARE REQIREMENT**:


 -**USING INTERNET**
  - ESP8266(Wi-Fi module)
  - relays(your choice)
  - jumpers 
  - adaptor(power ,5v)
  - Wi-fi or internet connection
  
  
 -**USING BLUETOOTH**:
  - Arduino-uno
  - Bluetooth module(HC-06)
  - relays
  - jumpers/connecting wires
  - adaptor
